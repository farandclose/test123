Understandably these changes cannot be made quickly as they require UI development, but it would be great to have more flexibility. A specific example is with the type of survey questions/formatting offered. It's fairly limited.

{'NPS Rating':9 ,
'Reason For Rating':'The tool fulfills it purpose, but periodically we experience bugs as well as not always following the logic behind the UX.',

{'NPS Rating':7 ,
'Reason For Rating':'I like the options  we have for building our own content, but we haven't had the best experience with the app being stable on our platform. Things have stopped working and disappeared unexpectedly. I hoped for less troubleshooting so early on in our rollout. ',

{'NPS Rating':7 ,
'Reason For Rating':'It's a good tool that has useful features. The user experience has been improving over time, but I still find some information hard to find or the order of operations confusing. Usually it's small things, for a simple example when I create a version of a flow in draft in order to edit it I would like to be brought into the drafts tab automatically since that's my next logical step. Otherwise it feels like nothing happened. ',

{'NPS Rating':8 ,
'Reason For Rating':'Whatfix has been a good partner and we are hoping to see value from this tool.  Our launch has been difficult, mostly due to internal J&J issues which has affected our ability to measure impact.  I see Whatfix as a valuable solution to meet the changing need for training and assistance within complicated applications like our Quality System Applications.  ',
 'One Thing that we can do better':'The ability of Whatfix to scale resources quickly, both up and down, has been a challenge as we are managing significant fluxes in workload and challenges with internal deadlines (which then impacts the deadlines with Whatfix content).  The local team keeps an open dialogue and we continue to work through challenges.  I also think this is an advantage for Whatfix as the team has been very receptive to changes.  Overall, I will say the tool is less simple to implement than I had hoped - even with a more updated platform (e.g. Salesforce), as we still have issues with content working out of the box.  Again the team is fast to respond and very willing to work with us, but this impacts our ability to self-serve on content development.''}

'Reason For Rating':'The benefits of having in app training content and we have had great support from the Whatfix team, especially with Aravind on board.',
 'One Thing that we can do better':'Right now it's more about us catching up with content creation to start using some of the other features that are available.''}
{'NPS Rating':5 ,
'Reason For Rating':'I think the team does a good job of explaining the tool and are hands on with the implementation.  However, support after go-live has not been the best.  The support rep was great, but I mean general support.  Also, we ran into some issues with adoption, which I feel like the team could have helped us address better from the beginning.',
 'One Thing that we can do better':'Providing better hyper care support after go-live.  Also, be proactive with know issues as it relates to SuccessFactors releases and impact on Whatfix flows and other content.''}
